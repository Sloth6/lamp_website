                        p All lamps are build with Cherry hardwood or laminated veneer. Cherry Wood has a rich pink to mild-red color that pairs well with warm colored papers. Wall and table lamps use an advanced method of 'Extreme Wood Bending' for directly bending specially treated pieces of solid hardwood.

                        p A type of Washi paper called Okawara was selected for its subtle and warm natural colors as well as balance with cherry wood and white walls. Both handmade and machine made Okawara papers are used. Okawara Paper is made of kozo fibers and sulfite.

                    p Strips of white 12V LED's are used in every lamp. LED's are the longest-lasting, most energy-efficient lighting method. Additionally, they can last up to 50,000 hours - 42 times longer than incandescent bulbs and 13 times longer than halogen bulbs.

                    This collection began as an exercise in restriction. How many lamps can be formed out of a curve and a box? This has proved to be an endlessly engaging design challenge. Any success of the lamps comes from the balance of many opposites. The box is the mass while the supporting curve provides the movement and energy. The material of the box is is light and airy while the curve is solid. The box is static while the curve is dynamic. The form is abstract while the materials are natural. The simplicity and energy of mid century modern  with the elegance and naturalistic character of traditional.
